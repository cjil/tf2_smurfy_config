Welcome to Smurfy Basketball!!

The goal is to dunk the intel into your opponent's net, just
like basketball.

Only Soldiers are allowed, shotguns are disabled.
Soldiers should equip the Gunboats to minimise RJ damage.

NOTE: The Rocket Jumper does NOT allow you to pickup the Intel.

Games work best when it's 2v2 or 3v3, this server is locked
to 2v2.  If there are more than 4 players the extra players are forced
to spectate.

Games end at 10 points, please let everyone have a turn. :)

Stay Smurfy!
