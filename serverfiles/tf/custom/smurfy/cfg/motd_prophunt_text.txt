Welcome to Smurfy PropHunt!

PropHunt is a hide & seek mod.  Red team spawns as props and hide.

Red team (props) - Left Click to lock your view so you can look
around without turning your prop and giving yourself away.
Right Click to change between 1st and 3rd person camera view.

Blu team (hunters) - Pyro is usually the best class.  As you shoot
you will lose health.

The Control Point (usually in the centre of each map) gives health
to both sides.
